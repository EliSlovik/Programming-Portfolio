## Movie Catalog
This is a movie catalog object oriented program. This application is for storing and sorting movies by genre, rating, and their 'watched' status. The object 'movie' has several paramenters that are inputed by the user whenever a new movie is added. The user can also sort movies and input a genre, and using a bubble sort, it prints all movies of the requested genre in order of rating, from high to low.
